Title: Adapt Numerical Records to Fit (in)Equality Restrictions
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Mark van der Loo
Description: Minimally adjust the values of numerical records in a data.frame, such
    that each record satisfies a predefined set of equality and/or inequality
    constraints. The constraints can be defined using the 'validate' package. 
    The core algorithms have recently been moved to the 'lintools' package,
    refer to 'lintools' for a more basic interface and access to a version
    of the algorithm that works with sparse matrices.
